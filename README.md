# rustnet
Rustnet is a botnet system developed in Rust and modeled after qBot. The project includes a server-side application and a client-side bot. The server manages connections from both admin users and bots, allowing admins to execute various commands such as counting connected bots, broadcasting messages, and initiating UDP flood attacks. The client-side bot connects to the server and awaits instructions.
